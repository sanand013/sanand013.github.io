## About
I'm a recent PhD from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at UC Berkeley, graduating in December 2024. I am advised by [Miki Lustig](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/), and I work on computational medical imaging. My thesis research is on motion sensing and correction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using radio frequency (RF) signals and machine learning techniques. I have experience in signal processing, machine learning, optimization, inverse problems for image reconstruction, and generative AI. During my PhD, I've been supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the UC Berkeley Chancellor's Fellowship for Graduate Study.

I did my undergraduate studies at MIT, where I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering (2017), and an M.Eng in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (2018). I worked with [Larry Wald](https://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/user/5615) at the A.A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging on MRI hardware.
